### [COLLECTIVE_SPECIES_INTELLIGENCE.md](./COLLECTIVE_SPECIES_INTELLIGENCE.md)
**Type**: Revolutionary Concept
**Status**: Visionary Framework
**Purpose**: Species as living, evolving model objects that grow through global BRUV contributions

**Core Concept**: Marine species exist as **living model objects** - multidimensional intelligences that continuously absorb new observations from global BRUV deployments. Each species becomes a collective consciousness containing all human knowledge about that species.

**Revolutionary Features:**
- **Growing Dice Model**: Species understanding adds facets with each contribution
- **Weighted Knowledge Integration**: Contributions weighted by quality, novelty, and scarcity
- **Federated Learning**: Models grow without centralizing raw data
- **Blockchain Attribution**: Immutable record of knowledge contributions
- **Real-time Applications**: Instant species ID, ecosystem health monitoring

**Knowledge Dimensions:**
- **Morphological Space**: Physical traits as evolving probability distributions
- **Behavioral Space**: Movement and behavior patterns as temporal models
- **Environmental Space**: Ecological niche as multidimensional preference surface
- **Individual Space**: Biometric recognition for tracking individuals

**Technical Implementation:**
- Distributed species models using federated learning
- Bayesian knowledge fusion for integrating observations
- Proof-of-Science consensus mechanism for validation
- IPFS + smart contracts for decentralized storage

**Economic Innovation:**
- Token economics rewarding quality contributions
- API access fees distributed to knowledge contributors
- Sustainable model for global research collaboration

**Transformation Potential**: Could transform marine biology from isolated research to truly global, collaborative science - the world's first collective intelligence for ocean life.
